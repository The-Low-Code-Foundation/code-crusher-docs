# OpenNoodl

Welcome to OpenNoodl, the open source Noodl / Fluxscape fork created by The Low Code Foundation. 

This fork aims to maintain and develop the original open source Noodl editor through community contributions and donations. For more info please visit [The Low Code Foundation homepage](https://thelowcodefoundation.com) and join us on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/eE3Q7Q67EN). 

In version 1.1.0, multiple changes have been merged from the Fluxscape fork of Noodl, with many small updates to certain nodes and some stability fixes, as well as switching to GPT-4o-mini for the AI Assistant.

Happy Noodling!
